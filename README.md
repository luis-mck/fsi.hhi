# FSI HHI (Helfilisten Hosting Interface)

## Introduction

Welcome! This software provides a web interface for managing shift schedules for
various events. Similar to the CCC's Engelsystem, it allows a digital shift
schedule to be distributed to all potential volunteers. The only requirements
are PHP (>=8) and a HTTP server. Configuration and data storage are handled via
two JSON files.

## Configuration

There are two JSON files: `config.json` for the main application configuration
and `shifts.json` (can be changed) for the actual shift schedule. Thera are also
sample files for these configurations. If you don't want to start from scratch,
just copy them for your actual configuration:

```
cp sample-config.json config.json
cp sample-shifts.json shifts.json
```

> [!CAUTION] Please make sure no one can access these config files via HTTP (=>
> .htaccess)!

For this purpose the project includes a sample `.htaccess` file.

*The key name in this table follows the syntax `key.subkey` =>
`{"key": {"subkey": value}}`*

### Details: `shifts.json`

The shift definition uses the following hierarchical structure:

- There is just one **Event** (like *Clubhausfest*)
- An **Event** has multiple **Tasks** (like *Main Bar*)
- A **Task** has multiple **Shifts** (like *19.00 PM to 21.00 PM*)
- A **Shifts** provides a limited amount of **Slots** (like *10 persons max*)
- A **Slot** is filled with an **Entry** (like *fsi.sebastian*)

For an example, have a look at `sample-shifts.json`.

#### Translation
While editing `shifts.json`, make sure to add text-variants for both english and german translation.
Every `i18nKey` needs to be unique.

After editing (and for initializing)`shifts.json`, make sure to run `make sync` in order to update the translation files.

## Test this project

Just run `make test` (because Makefiles are superior). This will host a local
webserver which listens on `0.0.0.0:8080` for testing purposes.

## Deploy this project

We provide both a `Dockerfile` and a docker compose file. Run

```
docker compose up --build
```

Or run `make docker`

## Data access

If you want to get a list of all entries with contact information, just call
`<baseUrl>?action=csvexport`. The system will send a mail with all entries as a
csv file to the configured admin mail address. **Attention!** From now on, the
pdf plan is also attached to this mail.

## Data privacy

If you want to prevent others from seeing all entry names, you can use the two
config options `hideNames` and `hidePdfExport` together. If set, all names are
only visible via the export feature which sents this data to the admin mail
address.

## Contribution

If you want to contribute: Feel free! There is a file called `AUTHORS` in the
repository root. If you want your name to be displayed within the website, you
can just add a line with your name there.
